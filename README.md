Project Work Overview

Throughout this project, I worked with both provided code and self-created components to develop a functional AI solution. The base code included pre-built reinforcement learning frameworks, which served as a foundation for implementing advanced AI models. I then wrote my own code to customize algorithms, optimize training processes, and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve performance. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning, neural networks, and AI-driven decision-making.
Connecting Course Learnings to Computer Science

This course primarily explored artificial intelligence through various machine learning techniques, with a strong emphasis on reinforcement learning. We examined methods such as Deep Q-Learning and compared different AI strategies, including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. The advancements in AI, particularly in automated decision-making and optimization, have transformed software development, as seen in the increasing capabilities of AI-powered tools like chatbots that assist with coding. Additionally, we discussed the growing importance of AI ethics, a critical topic as AI systems become more sophisticated and widely integrated into industries.
The Role of Computer Scientists

Computer scientists engage in continuous problem-solving by applying the scientific method—hypothesizing, experimenting, and analyzing results. Whether they are developing new algorithms, refining existing systems, or exploring emerging technologies, their work drives innovation and efficiency across various fields. The significance of this role lies in advancing technology, optimizing processes, and solving real-world challenges through computational solutions.
Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist

One of the greatest challenges for newcomers in computer science is properly defining a problem. A strong approach involves clearly outlining the scope of the issue, identifying critical system components, and mapping out the flow of data. Once these key elements are established, it becomes significantly easier to develop, test, and refine a solution. This structured methodology ensures that problems are tackled systematically and effectively.
Ethical Responsibilities to Users and Organizations

Defining ethical responsibilities in AI and software development is complex, as rigid guidelines can sometimes limit innovation or service delivery. However, the core principle should always be honesty and transparency. The ethical distinction between acceptable and unacceptable practices often lies in user consent—ensuring that end users have a clear understanding of how their data is being used. By prioritizing openness and informed decision-making, developers can uphold ethical integrity while still delivering effective and responsible AI solutions.
